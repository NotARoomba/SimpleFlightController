## 10/26/2025 - Started Guide and Schematic  

I started writing the guide, it is over 400 lines with images and I have also been writing step by step how everything works from the ground so that anyone who reads it can kind of understand the different concepts that there are in advanced PCB design. 

I then started the schematic and just finished routing the battery charger and also the USB-C port.
